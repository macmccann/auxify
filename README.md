# The Auxify Installation Guide

## Download Dependencies
If you already have npm installed, navigate to your auxify folder and run 'npm install'.
Otherwise, download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), navigate to your auxify folder, and run 'npm install'.

## Start up the app
If you don't have the .env file required to run the app, [generate a new set of Spotify application keys](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications) and put them in a .env file with the names "CLIENT_ID" and "CLIENT_SECRET".
In the main directory, run 'node app.js'

## Navigate to localhost:8888
Auxify should be ready to go! Just open up your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:8888!
